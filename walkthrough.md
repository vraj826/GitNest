# Repository Indexing, Dependency Graphs, Impact Analysis, Architecture Mapping & Health Governance

GitNest now includes a lightweight in-process repository indexing pipeline for JS/TS code intelligence, dependency graph impact analysis, architecture risk mapping, and repository health governance.

## What changed

- `RepositoryIndexer` runs through the existing saga queue/orchestrator.
- Repository crawling reuses the security crawler and skips `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, binaries, and files over 1MB.
- JS/TS extraction supports functions, classes, imports, exports, and Express routes using small regex utilities.
- `IndexedSymbol` stores searchable symbol metadata with indexes on `repositoryId`, `symbolName`, and `symbolType`.
- `DependencyGraph` stores module, package, export, route handler, and service/controller reference edges.
- `DependencyGraphBuilder` rebuilds edges from the same crawl/extract pass and replaces stale edges after indexing.
- `ImpactAnalysis` uses simple in-memory BFS over stored edges for direct dependencies, dependents, affected symbols/files, and depth counts.
- `ArchitectureAnalysis` persists a generated architecture snapshot after dependency graph generation.
- `ArchitectureMapping` derives module relationships, entry points, service boundaries, dependency density, hotspots, and bounded circular dependencies from `IndexedSymbol` and `DependencyGraph`.
- `RiskScoring` returns deterministic `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, or `CRITICAL` risk levels from dependency count, coupling, cycles, and hotspot participation.
- `RepositoryHealth` stores deterministic health snapshots with overall, security, architecture, activity, and maintainability scores.
- `HealthScoring` aggregates existing security events, dependency graph data, architecture analysis, activity, and pull request metrics after architecture analysis completes.
- `RepositoryGovernance` returns a summary, score breakdown, and rule-based recommendations such as security findings, high dependency coupling, excessive architecture risk, and low activity.
- REST APIs were added under `/api/v1/repositories/:username/:reponame`.

## APIs

- `POST /index` triggers indexing.
- `GET /index/status/:indexId` returns saga status and summary.
- `GET /symbols/search?q=name&symbolType=function` searches indexed symbols.
- `GET /symbols/:symbolId` returns symbol details.
- `POST /dependencies/rebuild` rebuilds the graph for a repository.
- `GET /dependencies` lists graph edges with optional `dependencyType`, `file`, and `symbol` filters.
- `GET /dependencies/impact?file=src/app.js` or `?symbol=handler` returns impact analysis.
- `GET /dependencies/symbol/:symbolName` returns dependencies and dependents for one symbol.
- `GET /architecture` returns the latest persisted architecture analysis.
- `GET /architecture/hotspots` returns hotspot metadata.
- `GET /architecture/risk` returns repository risk metadata.
- `GET /architecture/module/:moduleName` returns module risk and relationships.
- `GET /health` returns the latest health snapshot with summary.
- `GET /health/history` returns recent health snapshots.
- `GET /health/breakdown` returns score breakdown and source metrics.
- `GET /health/recommendations` returns rule-based governance recommendations.

## Verification

```bash
cd backend
npm test -- architecture.test.js
npm test -- repositoryHealth.test.js
npm test -- codeIntelligence.test.js
npm test
npm run test:contracts
```

Current local note: contract tests pass. The integration suite could not complete in this environment because MongoMemoryServer fails to start with `Cannot start server with an unknown storage engine: ephemeralForTest`.
